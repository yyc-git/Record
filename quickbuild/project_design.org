load:

one main model


part -> step


step -> part as sub models


isPrimitive

computeIsPart


remove cleanup ???



Generator basic primitives, not load them!!!



setPartType














generate:


one file = one part 


main model->each sub model has(main model shouldn't be part!):
one line geometry(one material) + one conditional line geometry(one material) +  multiple triangle geometries(key is color id. one color id has one triangle geometry)?





one part:
use idx to map vertex in vertices array

merge one part's all (geometries and sub models' geometries) -> vertices to one vertices array

one color id of the triangle point has one mesh+one geometry+one material




main model/FILE isn't part, so go to:
 this.steps.forEach(step => step.generateThreePart(loader, c, p, r, cull, inv, mc, taskList));
